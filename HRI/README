The turtle can understand the following commands:

1. GO STRAIGHT: Keep the orientation, and set the linear velocity to a constant
2. LEFT TURN: Increase the angular velocity a little bit
3. RIGHT TURN: Decrease the angular velocity a little bit
4. GO FASTER: INcrease the linear velocity a little bit
5. GO SLOWER: Decrease the linear velocity a little bit
6. STOP: Fully stop, and keep the current position and orientation
